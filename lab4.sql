No, you can not delete VA from the name table because of the 1 to M relationship
--4.2
No, because 80 is not a valid fips
--4.3
They are just fine

--4.5
 Yes, perfect 
--4.6
SELECT s.name, i.income
FROM income i
JOIN stat s ON i.fips = s.fips
WHERE i.year = 2023
ORDER BY i.income DESC
LIMIT 1;
--It is Washington DC
it works

To calculate the population growth rate for each year over the past five years in Virginia (VA), you can modify the SQL query to compare each year's population with the previous year. Here's how you can do it:

### SQL Query:
```sql
WITH population_data AS (
    SELECT 
        year, 
        population
    FROM 
        state_population
    WHERE 
        state = 'VA'
        AND year >= YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - 5
)
SELECT 
    current.year AS year,
    current.population AS current_population,
    previous.population AS previous_population,
    ((current.population - previous.population) / previous.population) * 100 AS growth_rate_percentage
FROM 
    population_data current
LEFT JOIN 
    population_data previous
ON 
    current.year = previous.year + 1
ORDER BY 
    current.year;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: `population_data` selects the population data for Virginia for the last five years.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Joins the current year's data with the previous year's data by matching the year.
3. **Growth Rate Calculation**: The formula calculates the growth rate percentage comparing the current year's population to the previous year's population.
4. **ORDER BY**: Orders the results by year for better readability.

This query will return the population growth rate for each year over the past five years, along with the populations for each year. 
Adjust the year extraction function if your SQL dialect uses a different method!
